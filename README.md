# opensimrt_core

Ros wrapper interface for the [OpenSimRT](https://github.com/mitkof6/OpenSimRT) project. 

This package is transitional, not recommended for use and it is planned to use OpenSimRT as a dependency to allow independent development.

## TODO:

- migrate ROS nodes to opensimrt_ros package.
